# Signals and Systems Tips

## Periodicity of a Signal
- The sum of two periodic signals is periodic only if the ratio of their respective periods T1 / T2 is a rational number otherwise if the ratio is irrational, x1(t) and x2(t) do not have a common period and hence to whole sum signal, x(t) cannot be periodic
- Fundamental perdiod of a Signal (T) is the LCM of the individual periods of the summing signals
- Sum of two periodic DTS is always periodic
