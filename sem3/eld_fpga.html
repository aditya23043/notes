  <h1>FPGA Architecture</h1>

  <pre><code>
CLB (Configurable Logic Block)
|__ 2 Slices
|   |__ Slice L (LUT can be used only for logic)
|   |__ Slice M / L (LUT can be used for both logic and memory / SRL)
|       |__ Mulitplexers
|       |__ Carry Chains (used for arithmetic operations)
|       |__ 4 Flip Flops / Latches
|       |__ 4 Additional Flip Flops
|       |__ 4 6-input LUTs
|           |__ A[6:1] = Address
|           |__ W[6:1] = Write Data
|           |__ O5 : outputted either through mux as (A/B/C/D)MUX or through flip flop (A/B/C/D)Q
|           |__ O6 : outputted directly as (A/B/C/D)
|           |__ F7(A/B)MUX is used to combine output of two 6-bit LUTs to obtain one 7-bit LUT
|           |__ F8(A/B)MUX is used to combine output of all four 6-bit LUTs to obtain one 8-bit LUT (256 locations)
|__ 8 LUTs
|__ 16 Flip Flops
|__ 2 Arithmetic &amp; Carry Chains
  </code></pre>

  <p>Note: Slice L only has address A[6:1], not data input W[6:1]; whereas, Slice M has both</p>
