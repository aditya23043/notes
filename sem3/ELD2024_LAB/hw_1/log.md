# CHANGES MADE TO THE TEMPLATE OF 4 bit FULL ADDER GIVEN ON GC
- Changes the dimension of OutSum from 5 to 4
- Declared a new variable overflow as an output
- Set the variable which gets the value returned by Carry out to the new overflow variable in the 4th Full Adder block

## NOTE
- I use a [neovim plugin](https://github.com/stevearc/conform.nvim) which formats my code automatically using the appropriate LSP (language server protocol) and since I set my text editor to neovim in Vivado's settings, the code looks formatted.
