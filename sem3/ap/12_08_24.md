## OOP FEATURES

### ENCAPSULATION
- Private and public methods withing classes / methods in order to prevent clients with less privilidge from accessing those functions
### METHOD OVERLOADING 
- Defining another function with same name with arguments with different data types in order to make it work with different data types
### INHERITANCE
- Child class copies all methods from inherited parent class
### ABSTRACTION
### METHOD OVERRIDING
### POLYMORPHISM
- If there are two child classes 'B' and 'C' that inherit from one parent class 'A'
- Since 'A' had function X() defined in it, 'B' and 'C' also inherit it
- But then if we override those X() functions in both 'B' and 'C' and then call B.X() then JVM ensures that the new X() function inside 'B' is only called and not the parent X() function from 'A'

## BITWISE OPERATORS

- | : or
- ^ : xor
