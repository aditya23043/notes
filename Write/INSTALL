Make sure your graphics driver is up-to-date, then run ./setup.sh
This script will install the SDL2 library required by Write and
create a desktop entry.

If Write's interface appears too small (or too large), enable
advanced preferences and enter the actual DPI (= horizontal
pixels/horizontal size in inches) for "Screen DPI" in the
Advanced section, then restart Write.  You may also wish to
adjust the default page size in Page Setup.

To remove the desktop entry created by Write, run:
    rm ~/.local/share/applications/Write.desktop
