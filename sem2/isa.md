## Introduction To Sociology And Anthropology

### Anthropology

> "*It is in human nature to make error*"
- Anthropo : Related to humans
- Cheating is not an error, it is considered fraud because of intention
- You can be forgiven for the first but punished for the other
- An electron moving the other way is not it's error but human error
- If an electron suddenly starts going the other way sometimes, then it is no longer an electron because it is not in it's nature
- So, is a person no longer human when they stop making mistakes?
- Difference between human nature and ~~physics~~ nature nature

### Sociology
- Sociology : Study of Society
- Cheating: Kunji = Easy way out
- Cheating assumes ~~somebody~~ something else knows the answer

- Goes to England; challenges and defeats almost everyone
- Goes to Poland and challenges the world champion, who doesn't shows up in the rematch
- Gama claims the title of champion
- Comes back to India
- Maharaja of Patiala adopts him as his wrestler
- Colonials believe that wrestlers represent masculinity
- The Maharaja of Patiala organised an Agricultural and Industrial Fare and a wrestling match was conducted between Gama and the wrestler he beat when he was in England and Gama beat the Wrestler in a single blow
- The headlines next day were, "India has Won"
- The Maharaja gifts Gama, his pearl necklace and lets him ride the King's Elephant along with a parade
- Gama, a middle-class person feels a sense of pride
- Wrestler -> Nationalist
> Gandhi is the person whose glasses have been stolen to make the "Swacch Bharat Abhiyan" Logo
- Gandhi challenges Gama
- Gama responds "I merely throw people around for entertainment whereas you have toppled the whole British Empire on its back, how can I fight you"
- Near the end of Gama's life in 1960s, Gama is lying down, defeated, but his moustache remains intact

## Punjabi Kinship
- In American Kinship, we observed that people are related either by shared genetic substance or by conduct/law
- Conjugal / Non - Conjugal
- In the West, they "openly" express love
- PDA is more common in the West as compared to India
- Note: 

| Symbol | Description    |
|--------|----------------|
| 󰔷      | Male           |
|       | Female         |
| 󰔷  =  | Married Couple |

- Family members not living in the same house are considered not to be a part of the family anymore (informally)
- In American Kinship, we saw that, the children of a family live in separate houses from their parents after marriage
- However, in Punjabi Kinship, we observe that sons live with their parents as a joint family and daugthers leave
- According to Punjabi Culture, the child gets blood from the mother and bones from the father
- In American Kinship, the mother and father provide equal genetic substance to their child
- Difference between the relation of an American Mother with her child as compared to a Punjabi Mother
- Mother's love stays constant and it cannot be shown directly i.e. it has to be disguised
- Child's love changes as the child grows older as there is competition for the Mother's Love
- Punjabi Mother cannot "openly" express love to her child because it might seem that she is being biased in providing more love to her child and not the other kids in the family and it might seem that others don't know how to express love to their child

# $14/03/2024$
## 1st Case
- The key feature of American Kinship is `love`
- Is it the same "love" in Punjabi Kinship? No, it is indirect.
- Love is not "openly" expressed in Punjabi Kinship
- In American Kinship, Love is essential in marriage and that's why there is no "love" marriage, there is just marriage
- In Punjabi Kinship, closing the door (showing intimacy/expressing love) during the day with the married couple inside is considered disrespectful for the elders of the family because.
- In American Kinship, that is not even in a question because only the couple live in the house with their children
- In American context, conjugal (not bound by blood) love is seen as natural
- Parents showing affection to their children is considered shameful in Punjabi Kinship
- Husband's wife and Husband's sister have a fight
- Sister complains
- Husband beats her wife up
- Considering Goffman's text and considering the beating as a performance, then what is the role played by the husband
- Why do all other family members believe it is alright to beat the women?
- Wife is not considered family because she is not of same blood
- The performance indicates his relation with his sister is better than his wife but why to prove this in such a way?
- At night, this guy makes love with his wife and assures her the beating was just to show the family. They make sure to be loud to show that in front of the family, on front stage he shows himself as a good family boy, but in private (i.e. at the back stage), he shows he loves his wife. The backstage is leaking to the frontstage in being loud.
- Why must love be "typically" silent in a punjabi female
- "Could be male dominance but he could have slapped both of them mentioning his tiring day at work" - Deepak Prince Sir

## 2nd Case
> "There is a lot of beating up going on here" - Deepak Prince Sir, 2024
- Geetinder (uncle of the child) slaps Maya's (Satinder's (Geetinder's brother) wife) Kid. The mother shouts "why did you hit the child?" and then the mother takes the child and locks the door
- Mother indirectly shows that Geetinder has no affection for the kid
- Another day, Satinder (elder bro) slaps Geetinder (younger brother) because younger brother had turned up the radio when he was trying to read
- Elders say the elder brother has been corrupted by his wife.
- So the elder brother goes to the kitchen, Mid child, Inder insists him to come back, the elder brother grabs a knife and cuts of his hand through which he had slapped his brother, not because he felt guilty but because he had been "corrupted" by his wife.
- Now, the family is partitioned.
- Husband, wife and child go off to live separately.
- What is the logic of expressing some things in the back and some things in the front.
- Why should the husband refrain from showing love to his wife in front of his family?
- Not considered socially apt in context of social roles
- Why did the family say their son moved out because the son wanted to be closer to his medical clinic.
- To maintain honour (prevent shame)

> "When a child does something shameful, the parents say they cannot show their face to others. Like something happens to their face, so next time you do something shameful, get some skin care routine" - Deepak Prince Sir,2024

> "Threatening to cut own's hand is part of the face care routine" - Deepak Prince Sir, 2024
- It is considered to be dishonourable to express intimacy with the spouse openly because it is shameful to follow the rules of the nature, i.e. behave like animals and suuccumb to animal instincts

## 3rd Case
- Story from a newspaper
- Daughter from the family is a doctor is in love with another doctor but that guy is Tamil
- To ensure nothing happens between those two, the two brothers goes to her workplace and kill their sister
- The author asked various people about this story
- Almost everyone responded "it was to preserve the honour of the family"
- There were two sets of responses when Vena Das asked if this was alright?
    - I would rather live with shame than have the blood of my daughter on my own hands - A bold father
    - People feeling sorry for the brothers that they had to kill one of their own (one who they shared womb with) to save their family's honour
- When a couple not able to conceive, the girl's side say its because of the husband, the boy's side say its because of the wife
    - in order to prevent the backstage leaking into the front and to save "face"
- When a mother's daugther comes back home from her in-laws and the mother feels her daughter is not feeling alright
- So, the mother asks her daugther-in-law to go and ask her daughter if everything is alright with her husband (backstage stuff)
- The mother believes that it is unacceptable for her to interfere with her daugther's sex life because they already share a "natural" relation

### "Bhaiya" / Biradari

- Many students call the TAs "bhaiya". They also call the security guard, the tea wala, cab driver etc "bhaiya" even if they might be as old as their friend's parents or even younger than the students themselves
- Why?
> "Why does no one calls the TA 'Saala'?" - Deepak Prince Sir, 2024
- Seen as an abuse
- TA might not be wife's brother
- Why sus? because not natural and not bound by blood
- The logic behind calling someone "bhaiya" is to show that the person can never have a marital relation with your sister
- In Mughal times, calling someone "bhaiya" excludes them from the list of people that can marry you

###
- Sometimes, younger siblings are adopted by their elder siblings
- The gift giving dynamics changes
- Read yourself

Cultural differences make relatedness actually different

Cultural Differences:


Young people in Nepal in the 90s wrote love letters. (Story)
90s: Econonmic liberalization took place
     this lead to acceptance of western cultural practices:
        not only are we wearing clothes of western brands, we are also following famous people like Michael Jackson, 
        Britney Spears, etc.

Story: 
Vajra and Sheela meet during the construction of a Youth club. 
Youth club: place where poeple connect with other people. 
    can also put this on the CV
Many things were built when the new Democratic Government was focusing on "Development":
    1. youth club
    2. health clinic
    3. tea shops
    4. primary school
    5. building for village development council meetings

Importance of Development:
    Just like a sapling needs water, sunlight, etc to grow into a tree, a country needs the right infrastructure to 
    develop.




FORMAT THIS:
Due to cultural differences, the relatatdness and idea of kinship changes.

People in nepal started writing love letters to express their feelings- usually young people.
In the 90’s
In the 90’s globalization and libralisation happened.
With globalisation, westernisation happened too. So the artifacts of west cultures also enter inside Nepal

Junigaon-
Vajra and shila were friends since kids  got closer due to construction of youth club.
Youth club → where young people gather. Forming a sense of community of like-minded people. It is also considered to be good to be a part of such clubs adds to the social value.

Developed roads, schools, shops, clinics- they wanted “Devlopement’ for Nepal.
Devlopement happens in time- seed growing into tree
But for nepal, development means forming a forest not a single tree.

And rn nepal is damaged with its soil.

We need a basic infrastructure to develop a seed to tree(water, sunlight)
Similiart we need some basic infrastructure to develop nepal
Govt has to think like farmers to develop nepal

If the country is developing- it has: high literacy rates, 

Determinists → everything happens as it does and couldnt happen any other way.
Strong linear correspondence between cause and effect.
—

Under the shadow of developing nepal, getting woman literate developed a stroy of love letters
a. Even though they lived within shouting distance of each other, there was no culturally
sanctioned way for them to ‘date.’ Although they occasionally had the opportunity
to sneak away together while working in the fields or going to the village tap to get
water, most of their courting took place through letters.

Comparing love in nepal and America →
In america it was more direct.
‘Fall in love’ - consciously happens.
(thats why consent comes from)
‘Love happens’ - not in my control, and cant be helped that i fall in love
(even before marriage or after marriage, it happens)                           

If you are in love→ you can do anything
The main meaning of love is life success.
 Life success → money, car, house(materialistic)--> economic success
For the lovers→ if you are in love, you can have this economic development.

–
The love letters had a flowery language→ symbolism of something beautiful.
And ellipses(...) → it doesnt have to be said

–
Love is also like a counter relationship.( daughter in law, mother in law)


— — — — — 

While the country was developing, the idea of love was developing and so does the family hierarchy

Hows  punjabi kinship diff from dravidian kinship

Tamils marry their cousins and call their "bua"-> "athai" (mother in law) 
Mothers younger sister is like small mother and similarly for the fathers side 

"Sondam" -> relatives and this same word is used to refer to ones belongings/possessions 


Kinship means "mine" in the dravidian kinship

In punjabi kinship the bride is an outsider where in this dravidian kinship shes treated as a relatives

#iit riz-jee banerji


for the point about contam its that it allows you to make claims , gives you rights 

"urimai" means rights, that you can basically assert over a thing/ person

---

"Suppose my daughter is married to my sister’s son and I pay a visit to her. I
reach their house but there is nobody home; the door is locked. But since it is
my own sister’s house, I can go in, take some food and feel at home. On the
other hand, if my daughter is married to a stranger, in the same situation, I
have to wait outside their house for their return. I cannot go in, otherwise my
daughter would be insulted by her in-laws. They would say that her father only
came here to steal food, that he wants to spoil them, that he does not respect
them etc. For this reason, it is better to marry close-relatives."


---

The guy means to say that its more convinient to marry a contam cuz therell be less "formalities"(which otherwise hell have to do if hes marrying his daughter to a stranger) in the realtionship  

Contam --> "mine is yours, and yours is mine" entitlement
Murai --> "code of conduct" and is often used with the word ceythal(means to do something) which afterall means following the code of conduct

"Murai ceythal" --> to do the right thing / follow the code of conduct

in tamil lifestyle one hase to do murai ceythal once in their life


Murai also means to specify an order or seqeunce in series(implies heirarchy too)--> everyone get their things in order 

---

So till now weve three meaning of murai --> code of conduct, to do the right thing thats when its used with the word ceythal, and the last thing is to to stuff in series

---

Doing the Right Thing at a
Woman’s Puberty Ceremony(Pg 28)
or 
Doin the right thing at the time of harvest(Pg 27)


What do these two things share?
Celebrating the idea of new life (new harvest is equivalent to the idea of women giving birth to children)

- Parallel Cousins vs Cross Cousins
- Cross cousins are children of siblings of different genders
    - e.g. Son of someone's sister can marry your daughter if you are a male and vice versa
- Parallel Cousins are children of siblings of same gender
- Parallel cousins cannot marry each other but parallel cousins can, according to dravidian kinship
> "Anyone here has a spare AA battery?" - Deepak Prince Sir, 2024
- Murai in Tamil means "right" in English
- In punjabi kinship the bride is an outsider where in this dravidian kinship shes treated as a relatives
    - The whole idea of punjabi kinship is to repress animal (natural) instincts
    - To maintain the honour of the family, the members carry out a performance to suppress their animal instincts
- In tamil kinship, in a relationship, people are more related (familiar)
    - Tamils marry within their own
    - "My Own" (sontham) : Claims, Entitlement
    - Murai --> "code of conduct" and is often used with the word ceythal(means to do something) which afterall means following the code of conduct
    - "claim" is something that you can assert / ask for, "entitlement" is something you have 
    - one of them is given to you before you exist : "entitlement" as citizens of this country
    - but when you have to apply for driving license, you have to make a claim
    - even if you are entitled to stuff, you have to make a claim
    - Relatives are something you can make a claim on
    - "Right Spouse"

## Kallar Right Spouse (MBD)
- Mother's brother's daugther : Matrilinial
- Eldest son of the eldest daughter and eldest daughter of the eldest son have the obligation to marry
- The obligation "to do the right thing" falls only on the eldest children
    - Therefore in a family with four siblings, and their children have to marry, their are at most 2 murai marriages
    > "If you want to see the whole madness in action of this tamil kinship watch 'In the Eastern Province'"
    - In the north, honour killing is done to preserve the honour of the family whereas here, it is to take revenge
- "Mayandi" : Interviewee (Eldest sister's son)
