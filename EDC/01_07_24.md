# Electronics Design Carnival 2024

## Electronics System Design - Prof. Sujay Deb

### What is Engineering?
- Purposeful use of science
- making stuff
- solving problems
- employ facts of nature to build very interesting systems
- conversion of nature to Engineering systems occurs through observation and abstraction
- Take complicate things, build layers of abstraction, and simplify thing so that we can build useful systems

### Abstractions in Modern Computing Systems
- Applications
- Algorithm
- Programming Language
- OS / VM
- ISA (instruction set architecture)
- Micro-architecture
- Register-Transfer level
- Gates
- Circuits
- Devices
- Physics

- Top level layers provide application requirements
- Lower level layers provide technological constraints
- The middle three layers provide feedback to guide application and technology research directions

- Both i9-* and i3-* processors can run similar os like windows and regular applications like ms docs etc
- The software related stuff is similar
- Then what is the difference?
- The microarchitecture is different

#### Register Transfer Logic
- Performance gain => Combinational Logic takes lesser time
- Clock cycles decide the processor speed

## Clock speed
- Intel introduced pentium series in the '90s
- Pentium 1 => running at some MHz
- Pentium 2 => running at 1 GHz
- Pentium 3 => running at 3 GHz
- Pentium 4 => running at 4 GHz
- But they could not increase the clock speed further due to technological constraints, majorly, insufficient heat dissipation
- Tech people were dreaming of higher and higher performance with higher clock speeds but now they hit a power wall
- Hence, now most chips run at 3.3GHz max
- They try to achieve better performance through multi-core processors

## Apple
- Earlier macbooks has intel processors
- To break through the constraints barrier, Apple decided to take control of all the abstractions layer themselves in order to get most out of the chip and make their software work in unison with their hardware

## ISAs
- All popular ISAs are owned by companies
- ARM owned by arm; x86 owned by intel; snapdragon owned by Qualcomm
- Hence, Indians are strongly promoting the open source RISC-V architecture ( competition to ARM architecture)
- RISC: Reduced instruction set computer
- Note: both RISC-V and ARM implement the RISC ideology whereas intel's x86 follows CISC (complex instruction set computer) architecture
- RISC based processors provide low power consumption alongside high performance
- Hence, intel could not survive in the mobile devices market

## Moore's Law
- The number of transistors in an IC doubles about every two years with minimal rise in cost

## Efficiency System Design Strategy
- Efficiency: Microprocessors < General Purpose DSP (Digital Signal Processors) < Dedicated
